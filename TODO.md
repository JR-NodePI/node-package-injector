TODO: Refresh branches and directories when focus on app window

TODO: Inject dependency in dependency selector --- or something similar

- ideas:
  - Could be a multiple selector for a dependency, listing other current dependencies, in order to select in witch dependencies you can inject this one.
  - Could be a simple check "Inject in all other dependencies before target"
  - Could be a collapsed checklist for a dependency, listing other current dependencies and you can pick them in order to inject this one before building.

TODO: Move FormValidation to components library
